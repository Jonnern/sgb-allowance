# sgb-allowance
Find & revoke token allowances.

IMPORTANT: You will always see your allowance history, also after revoking them (i.e. setting the spend limit = 0).

Web Dapp: https://sgb-allowance.ftso.eu 

## How it works
This tool works by searching all your transactions on the Flare blockchains to find the approval transactions; from there you are then able to revoke each one or even visit their dapp (if available).

## Add a dapp to the list
Fork this repo and add your dapp to the list [here](https://github.com/ftso-eu/sgb-allowance/blob/master/src/helpers/dapps.js) or submit an [issue](https://github.com/ftso-eu/sgb-allowance/issues).
You can also use https://twitter.com/ftso_eu to speed up this process.
