# sgb-allowance
Show & revoke flare network token allowances.

IMPORTANT: You will keep watching your allowance history, also after revoking them (i.e. setting the spend limit = 0).

Web Dapp: https://sgb-allowance.ftso.eu 

## How it works
This tool works by searching all your transactions on the Flare blockchains to find the approval transactions.

It shows the  approval transactions in chronological order from the most recent to the oldest.

You can check if the latest one is not zero and set it to zero clicking on "Revoke".

## Add a dapp to the list
Submit an [issue](https://github.com/ftso-eu/sgb-allowance/issues) to add a spender address to a dApp friendly name.
